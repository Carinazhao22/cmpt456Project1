	    The BBC Global 30 is a worldwide stock market index, run as a global economic barometer. Started by the BBC on 29 September 2004, it mixes the economic information of 30 of the world's largest companies based in three continents. So far it has proved to be very volatile, as many of the companies have had major gains and losses.
